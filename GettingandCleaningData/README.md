* This script downloads the necessary files, unzips them, loads in the raw data, transforms the data, and creates a tidy dataset called tidyDataset.
* Please see the codebook for information about the transformations used to create the tidy dataset.
* Built in R version 3.1.1 (2014-07-10)
* Requires packages dplyr and tidyr, which are automatically loaded in the code.
