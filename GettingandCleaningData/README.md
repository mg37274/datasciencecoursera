## About run_analysis.R
* This script loads in the raw data, transforms the data, and creates a tidy dataset called tidyDataset.
* If you do not have the necessary files, uncomment lines 5-7 before running to also download and unzip files into your current working directory.
* Please see the codebook for information about the transformations used to create the tidy dataset.
* Built in R version 3.1.1 (2014-07-10)
* Requires packages dplyr and tidyr, which are automatically loaded in the code if needed.
